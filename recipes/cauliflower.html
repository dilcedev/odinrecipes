        <p>Roasted cauliflower is a simple yet flavorful dish that's perfect as a side or a light snack. The cauliflower florets are tossed in olive oil and seasoned with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper to enhance their natural taste. Roasting at high heat brings out the vegetable’s sweetness while also achieving a crispy, golden exterior. The result is tender, slightly caramelized cauliflower that’s both satisfying and healthy. It’s a versatile dish that can be garnished with fresh herbs or a squeeze of lemon for extra freshness.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium cauliflower (cut into florets)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley (for garnish, optional)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges (optional)</li>        
    </ul>
    <h2>Here's how you make it:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Preheat the Oven: </b>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li><b>Prepare the Cauliflower: </b>Wash and cut the cauliflower into small florets. Try to keep them similar in size for even cooking.</li>
        <li><b>Season the Cauliflower: </b>In a large bowl, toss the cauliflower florets with olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Make sure the cauliflower is evenly coated.</li>
        <li><b>Arrange on a Baking Sheet: </b>Spread the seasoned cauliflower in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. This helps to avoid sticking and makes cleaning easier.</li>
        <li><b>Roast the Cauliflower: </b>Roast the cauliflower in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, turning halfway through, until the cauliflower is golden and tender. You can check for tenderness by piercing a floret with a fork.</li>
        <li><b>Serve: </b>Once roasted, remove from the oven. Garnish with fresh parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice if desired. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
